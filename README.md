# Remove-Darkness

A lightweight **Fabric mod** that disables Minecraft’s *darkness visual effect* in **singleplayer** worlds.

## ⚠️ Usage Notice

This mod is **for singleplayer use only**.  
If you want to use it on a **multiplayer server**, download and install the **[Server Plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/rde-plugin)** instead.

Using client-side mods on servers without permission can violate their rules.  
**Always check server policies before joining.**

## 🧩 Overview

**Remove-Darkness** removes the “darkness” overlay that appears in low-light conditions (such as during Warden encounters or the Darkness potion effect).  
It does **not** change brightness, mob behavior, or gameplay — only the **visual overlay** is affected.
