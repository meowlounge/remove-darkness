# Remove-Darkness

A lightweight Fabric mod that disables Minecraft’s **darkness visual effect**.

---

## 🧩 Overview

**Remove-Darkness** removes the “darkness” screen overlay effect that appears in low-light situations (for example, during Warden encounters or the Darkness potion).
It does **not** modify light levels, mob behavior, or gameplay mechanics. Only the **visual overlay** is toggled.

## ⚙️ Features

* Toggle the effect **on or off** with a hotkey.
* **Default key:** `G`
* Can be rebound in *Options → Controls → Remove Darkness → Toggle*.
* Works entirely client-side.
* No network traffic, no external connections, and no gameplay advantages.

**Always check server rules before use.** Use at your own discretion and risk.
